# EndlessRunner
The current game was developed using the Assets found in the Unity Assets Store and in the TurboSquid. These Assets were only used as preview about the game and how it will work. 
## Game Overview 
College Degree is a 3D third-person endless runner game for mobile devices. The objective is to run as far as you can across three lanes in order to achieve the degree, reach a high score or complete missions. The player can choose to control a university student called Jenifer or Rodrigo and run through the scenario. 
While running the player must avoid, by touching the screen, oncoming obstacles and trying not to sleep. If the player doesn’t collect coffee icons, he’ll sleep, by sleeping it is game over. If the player collect too much coffee, the game will become faster.  If the player hits an obstacle, it is game over.
## Observation
